# NLPSystems-Task_1
Web Services (fastAPI and Streamlit)
I am using fastAPI for both tasks one and two (Not Flask)

TASK_1
In order to test task one, run fastAPI.py in the console and it will return you http://127.0.0.1:5000 as requested; clicking on this URL and addeing /api you will see 
the note that "System is ON and you can use it to find NERs". Then opne the fastAPI_requests.py to send the requests by running the code using console; go back to your 
web page and see the results. 

TASK_2
In order to test task two, run fastAPI_web.py in your console and open the web page. There you will find the table to enter you data.

TASK_3
In order to test task three, run stream.py in the console and it will automatically guide you to the URL. Make sure you spend enough time and you test all fun 
features of the link and submit your information. I am using a database to save all the information and display them to you after submission.
